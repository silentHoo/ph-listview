# ph-listview

This component requests data from a given feed and lists them in a listview powered by `<core-list>`. You provide a
custom parse function which is used to parse your feed data. This can either be of type xml, json or rss.

Two predefined views are available to choose from: `compact` and `default`. The compact one doesn't include any
image and only shows the title, the date, the category and a link to click on to read more on the destination site. The
default one shows an additional image and the full description.

RSS feeds are per default parseable without the need of providing a custom parse function. If you're providing your
own parse function, you must return an array which aligns with the following format:

    ...
    [{
      title: 'My Title',
      date: '2010-01-01T05:06:07',
      category: 'My Category',
      description: 'A bit more text',
      link: 'http://www.google.com/'
    }]
    ...

Please note: The date must be parseable by the `Moment.js` library. If you use a custom format you can refer to the 
[String + Format section](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/) for more information of valid string formats.

##### Example 1

    <ph-listview
      id="listView"
      feed="https://api.github.com/orgs/google/repos"
      handleAs="json"
      viewType="compact"
      sortByDateAsc="false"
    ></ph-listview>

NOTE: Provide a JavaScript function to parse custom xml (see below)

##### Example 2

    <ph-listview
      id="listView"
      feed="https://api.github.com/orgs/google/repos"
      handleAs="json"
      viewType="default"
      sortByDateAsc="true"
    ></ph-listview>

NOTE: Provide a JavaScript function to parse custom xml (see below)

##### Imperative JavaScript Code for Example 1 + 2

    this.$.listView.setResponseParseFunc(function (response) {
      var xmlNodeTree = response.querySelectorAll('entry'); // we only use the <entry>s

      var entries = [];
      for (var i = 0; i < xmlNodeTree.length; i++) {
        var node = xmlNodeTree[i];
        var media = node.querySelector('group');

        entries.push({
          title: node.querySelector('title').textContent,
          date: node.querySelector('published').textContent,
          link: node.querySelector('link[rel="alternate"]').getAttribute('href'),
          category: media.querySelector('category').getAttribute('label'),
          description: media.querySelector('description').textContent,
          thumb: media.querySelectorAll('thumbnail')[0].getAttribute('url')
        });
      }
      return entries;
    });

##### Example 3

      feed="http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/webwelt/?service=Rss"
      handleAs="rss"
      viewType="default"
